# Hello-world

Just another repository...

I'm new to the world of programming and looking to learn as much as can as quickly as I can. Hoping to make this my career now but still undecided on exactly where and what I want to do with it all... so far I'm at the real basics with HTML and CSS but I wanna work my way up and find where I eventually want to place myself working with code.
